	<h4>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h4>

		<p>At the moment, my main focus and occupation is working towards the Extension School's Masters degree in Software Engineering. This is a completely new direction for me, since as an undergraduate, I focused on the humanities and anticipated becoming a high school or middle school English teacher. I could write you an essay on all my thoughts and feelings about teaching and why I've ultimately turned away from that path, but suffice to say: at some point, I stumbled across the idea of programming and it's taken hold.</p>

	<h4>Why are you taking this course?</h4>
	
		<p>I am eager to become more familiar and more practiced at web development and this course seems like an excellent way to do that! </p>


	<h4>What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h4>
		
		<p>Not a whole lot at this point. I started playing around with HTML a bit when I was a little kid, mostly just to mark up text on blogs and forums (as well as a handful of web pages (dinky, flashy (lots of marquee tags!) and essentially contentless) hosted by Expages/Angelfire/Geocities way back in the day). I've been familiar with the basics for a long time, but never moved beyond that until recently.</p>
		<p>Although still far from an expert, I've come a long way in the last year. "CS50" and "Visualizations" familiarizezd me with the structure of HTML documents and let me begin playing around with manipulating the DOM through javascript, jquery and d3. And this spring, for "Introduction to Content Management Systems," I practiced custom templating using HTML and CSS, incorporating Bootstrap some of the time, ultimately creating three variations of the same website though three different popular CMS's: <a href="http://stephanied.siteground.net/joomla/">Joomla</a>, <a href="http://stephanied.siteground.net/wordpress/">Wordpress</a>, and <a href="http://stephanied.siteground.net/drupal/">Drupal</a>.</p>
	
	<h4>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h4>
		
		<p>CS-50, last fall (so, a fair amount of C, followed by quick crash courses in PHP, SQL, and Javascript/Jquery). This spring I also completed "Java for Distributed Computing" which involved building several rather complex Java packages in an IDE.
	
	<h4>Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h4>

		<p>Minimally. CS50 is the extent of it--for my final project, I decided to try creating an online turn-based game that functioned mainly by taking user input and logging it in a MySQL database via PHP, which was queried at the start of each subsequent "move" by the user to determine what sorts of output the user might receive. (The end product was pretty rough around the edges, as it was essentially an attempt to go from 0 to 60 in what felt like a pretty short time.)</p>

	<h4>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h4>
		<p>PC, Windows 8.</p>

	<h4>Anything else we should know?</h4>
		<p>Nothing pressing that I can think of at the moment!</p>
