This is my submission for PSET1 for Dynamic Web Applications, testing out the workflow that will be used for future projects in this course: creating a git repository, connecting that repository to a github repository and tracking changes to repository files with commits, which are pushed to github as well as, ultimately, to a hosting framework.
